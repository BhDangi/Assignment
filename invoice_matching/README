# Invoice Similarity Matching System

## Objective
This system automatically categorizes incoming invoices by matching them to existing templates or previously processed invoices based on content and structural similarity.

## Approach

### Document Representation
- **Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from PDF invoices.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features such as invoice number, date, and amount using regular expressions.

### Similarity Metric
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between text documents using TF-IDF vectors.

## Instructions

### Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2 scikit-learn

2. Prepare Data:

Place your test invoices in the test folder.
Place your train invoices in the train folder.

3.Run the Script:

python app.py

4.View Results:

The script will print the most similar train invoice and the similarity score for each test invoice.
